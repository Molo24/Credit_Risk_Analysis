# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to leverage machin learning (ML) tools and alorithms to study credit risk. The data used was from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. This dataset was analyzed following Supervised Machine Learning techniques, including: regression, classifications, resampling and training among others.

The dataset was oversampled using the ```RandomOverSampler```, ```SMOTE``` algorithms, undersampled using the ```ClusterCentroids``` algorithm and over/undersampled using the ```SMOTEENN``` alorithm. Finally, ```BalancedRandomForestClassifier``` and ```EasyEnsembleClassifier``` machine learning models were used to reduce bias and to predict credit risk. 

Tools used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, ```imbalanced-learn``` Python libary and the ```scikit-learn``` Python library.
